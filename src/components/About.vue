    <div class="content">
      <p>Born in Poland, 18 years old software developer and student.</p>
      <p>
        My journey with programming started about three years ago with python,
        but javascript was first language I mastered. Nowadays, I'm mostly
        comfortable working on frontend development, particularly with Vue.js.
        However, I'm open to learning new languages and technologies.
      </p>

        Outside of coding, I also enjoy reading, weightlifting, running and
        chess. Recently, I've also picked up playing the guitar.
