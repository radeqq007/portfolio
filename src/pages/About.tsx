      <p>Born in Poland, 18 years old software developer and student.</p>
      <p>
        My journey with programming started about four years ago with Python,
        however javascript was the first language I truly learned. Nowadays I'm
        mostly working on frontend with Vue.js, React and Tailwindcss, but I am
        constantly learning new technologies and languages.

        Outside of coding I also enjoy reading, weightlifting and playing the
        guitar.
