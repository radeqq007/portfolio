      <p>Born in Poland, 17 years old software developer and student.</p>
      <p>
        My journey with programming started about three years ago with python,
        but I quickly switched to javascriptm, which was the first language is
        got good at. Nowadays, I'm mostly working on front-end, most often with
        Vue.js. However, I'm always open to learning new languages and
        technologies.

        Outside of coding, I also enjoy reading (classical novels in
        particular), weightlifting and running. Recently, I've also picked up
        playing the guitar.
